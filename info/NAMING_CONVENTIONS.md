# Recommended Naming Conventions Used in *acspype* 

The following defined variables are in reference to a single ACS sample or spectrum.

[ArrayLike](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html) indicates that the variable can be represented as a 1-dimensional (1xN) list, tuple, or numpy array.

[NDArray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html) indicates that the variable can be represented as a 2-dimensional (MxN) list, tuple, or numpy array.
