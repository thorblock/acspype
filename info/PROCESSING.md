|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.0      | Find Packet               | Read the serial stream and parse out a full ACS packet.                                                                                                                                                |
| 0.1      | Split/Parse Packet        | Split a packet into its raw constituents as defined by the [ACS manual](https://www.seabird.com/asset-get.download.jsa?id=69833852764). (e.g. record_length, a_signal, raw_internal_temperature, etc). |
| 0.2      | Run Syntax Test           | Verify that the packet length matches the record length and verify the checksum.                                                                                                                       |
| 0.3      | Run Gap Test              | Check the assigned packet timestamp and the serial port buffer for pile up.                                                                                                                            |
| 0.4      | Import ACS Device File    | The serial number from the parsed packet can be used to automatically identify a corresponding device file.                                                                                            | 
| 0.5      | Calibrate Packet          | Calibrate the packet using the device file to produce products in engineering units (e.g. a_m, internal_temperature)                                                                                   |
| 0.6      | Import TSCor Data         | TS-correction does take time to perform each loop, but can be done in a single thread.                                                                                                                 |                    
| 0.7      | TS Correct Packet         | OPTIONAL: Apply TS correction to data in the packet, if ancillary temperature and salinity are available. (e.g. a_mts)                                                                                 |
| 0.8      | Run Additional QAQC Tests | OPTIONAL: Run elapsed time test, internal temperature test, and Inf Nan Test on uncorrected data. These test can probably be done during data acquisition on a single thread.                          |

| 1.0      | Import ACS Device File and TSCor                                                                 | Yes                         | Import a corresponding ACS device file (ACS-XXX.dev) and TS-correction coefficients (TS4.cor). These files are provided by Sea-Bird Scientific.                                                                                                                           | The TS4.cor file from SBS should be the same for all ACS. *acspype* has these coefficients hardcoded. It is strongly recommended to rename the .dev file to ACS-XXXXX_YYYY-MM-DD.dev, where XXXXX is the zero padded serial number (00011) and YYYY-MM-DD is the date of calibration in the device file, to avoid overwritting device files if stored in the same folder. |
| 1.1      | Compute Internal Temperature                                                                     | Yes                         | Compute internal temperature of the sensor from raw counts. This data is needed for calculation of the measured (a_m, c_m) coefficients.                                                                                                                                  | The external temperature isn't used in processing ACS data, but can also be calculated at this stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1.2      | Calculate Absolute Salinity and Conservative Temperature                                         | No (Use GSW)                | The use of TEOS-10 salinity/temperature over EOS-80 salinity/temperature variable should not impact the TS-correction of spectra significantly. However, it is recommended, particularly if other physical properties of seawater of interest in analysis (e.g. density). | This requires a co-located CTD or TSG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1.3      | Compute Uncorrected Absorption (a_uncorrected) and Attenuation (c_uncorrected)                   | Yes                         | Compute the uncorrected absorption and attenuation in inverse meters (m^-1).                                                                                                                                                                                              | This is the first step in the processing chain where the ACS data is converted from raw counts to engineering units. Comparing uncorrected values may be useful in identifying debris or bubbles in the flow path.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1.4      | Compute Measured Absorption (a_m_discontinuity) and Attenuation (c_m)                            | Yes                         | Compute the measured absorption and attenuation in inverse meters (m^-1).                                                                                                                                                                                                 | *acspype* uses the measured (m) subscript because the filtration state of the medium is unknown. Use of the particulate-gelbstoff (pg), particulate (p), and gelbstoff (g) subscripts should be applied later at user discretion.                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.5      | OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED: Correct Measured Absorption (a_m) and Attenuation (c_m) for Discontinuity | Yes                         | Correct the measured absorption and attenuation for the observed discontinuity jump that occurs roughly halfway in each spectra.                                                                                                                                          | This step applies a scalar offset to the second half of the spectra to create a smoother spectrum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1.6      | OPTIONAL: Apply User-Collected Pure Water Coefficients                                           | No                          | Apply an additional pure water offset derived by the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This may require multiple calibrations. Linear interpolation between two or more user created offsets will help assess and remove sensor drift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1.7      | Time Lag Correction                                                                              | No                          | Using known volume, flow rate, and co-located sensors, shift ancillary variables to match the time the same water enters the ACS.                                                                                                                                         | This requires a nearby CTD or TSG and knowledge of the flow rate of water pumped through the ACS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.8      | Compute TS-Corrected Absorption (a_mts) and Attenuation (c_mts)                                  | Yes                         | Using ancillary temperature (conservative temperature) and salinity (absolute salinity), correct spectra for the effect of temperature and salinity.                                                                                                                      | This requires a nearby CTD or TSG. DO NOT USE THE ACS EXTERNAL TEMPERATURE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A common reason is that the one or multple reference counts contain the value of 0, which propagate to NaN when performing a log operation and remain at each processing step.                                                        | Not Applicable                                                                  | No             | 4, 1                 | If a NaN exists in the spectrum, it should probably be discarded. Repeated NaNs (or zero reference counts) in uncorrected values may indicate that factory recalibration is needed or an instrument malfunction.                                                                                                                                           |
| A Greater Than C Test     | Check if uncorrected absorption is greater than attenuation. Consecutive values in a spectrum and over time may indicate bubbles or a stuck object in the flow cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not Applicable                                                                  | No             | 3, 1                 | This test should be used to consider data suspect, but should not be used to immediate remove data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Gross Range Test          | On TS and scattering corrected spectrum, run the gross range test, which will assign a flag for each wavelength in a spectra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Fail Threshold = [0, 10]<br>Suspect Threshold = [0.001,8.5]                     | Yes            | 4, 3, 1              | Some may find that this results in fail flags in the red wavelengths, even after correction. This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blanket Gross Range Test  | Assigns a blanket flag to the entire spectrum if a certain percentage of coefficients across the spectrum are flagged as fail. This is useful for identifying spectra that are not suitable for further processing.                                                                                                                                                           | Ignore Wavelengths = [700, 755]<br>Fail Threshold = 10<br>Suspect Threshold = 5 | No             | 4, 3, 1              | This may be useful for identifying poor quality spectra. Users should review the neigboring spectrum samples to see if the issue is persistent or a one-off. If only one spectrum is found as failed while the neighboring spectrum are ok, then it could probably be removed before analysis is performed without a significant impact on the end result. | 
| Rolling Variance Test     | Assigns a flag at each wavelength bin of spectrum if the variance over time exceeds a percentage of the mean. A rolling centered window is used to calculate the variance and a flag is assigned to the central sample.                                                                                                                                                       | Percentage = 10<br>Window Size = 7<br>                                          | No             | 3,1                  | Suspect flags may indicate bubbles or debris in the flow cell.
